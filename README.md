    What a great question! I am currently working my way through the second book, so I have more specific opinions about that. Of those I've learnt from the first book, I found the following to be less tricky:


    The C major prelude, of course. Curtis is right about the difficulty of the fugue, however.
    c minor prelude and fugue are a good first pair to learn
    c# minor prelude is a nice lyrical dance movement whose difficulties are mostly due to  the tricky key. The fugue on the other hand is quite complicated, although the difficult bit here is mostly playing 5 voices at the same time, not playing fast or complicated figures.
    The D major fugue is also quite simple as fugues go. It looks more imposing on the page than it really is (the fast fanfare figures only occur in one hand at a time, and there is a lot of stuff which is basically chords). The D major prelude is not too hard either. Most people make it hard by playing it too fast.
    The d minor fugue is another fairly simple fugue -- no harder than the c minor one, I would say. The prelude is a workout for arpeggio playing which can be difficult if you have problems with tension in your arms and wrists.
    Eb minor prelude is a very nice slow sarabande with mostly chords in the left hand and the right hand playing the role of a solo instrument. The fugue is difficult though (d# minor!).
    The E major prelude is not too hard, and very pretty -- another dance-like piece
    The e minor fugue is in two parts only, which obviously makes it somewhat simpler to learn. The first half of the e minor prelude is not bad, but it gets harder at the second half marked "presto"!
    Finally, the F major prelude and fugue is another nice pair to start with -- on about the same level as the c minor and d minor.


    Here are the pieces I've found easier in book two, so far:


    The C major fugue is quite straightforward. The prelude is not very hard but sustaining the long notes and making the whole thing flow can be tricky.
    The c minor prelude is more or less a two-part invention. The fugue is for four parts, but only in three for long stretches -- maybe a good first four-voiced fugue to learn?
    The D major prelude has a lot of repeating patterns of scales and arpeggios which eases the learning a bit, and the fanfare-like character makes it easier to get into compared to some of the more abstract pieces. The fugue is not bad for a four-part fugue, but it requires a good legato on the piano to keep the voices connected.
    d minor prelude is another invention, and the three-part fugue is straightforward, although rhythmically and harmonically peculiar (lots of chromatic descending scales)
    The E major and Eb fugue are not too tricky for four-part fugues. Their preludes are moderately difficult, I'd say. 
    The F major fugue is fast but not really very complicated, if you've played something like a Gigue from a French Suite.
    The f minor prelude is simple and beautiful; the f minor fugue (3 voices) is not bad apart from the tricky key. I'd say the same about the f# minor prelude.
    The G major fugue is fast and fun -- mostly arpeggios. The prelude is similar. Like the d minor prelude from book one, they can be tiring if you have trouble playing arpeggios and similar wrist-rotation techniques in a relaxed way (or when taken too fast ;->)


    Wow, that's much more than I meant to write. Hope it's useful to someone! I haven't really gotten much further than halfway with either book, so there may well be other less-difficult pieces which I've overlooked. But I think these are reasonable starting points.
